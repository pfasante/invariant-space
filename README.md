The 'auto' program implements an automatic search for invariant subspaces.

The program itself is generic and independent of any primitive. Primitives
come as a form of plugin to the main program, in separate header files.

The main program, auto.c, as well as the Zorro, Robin and Fantomas plugins,
are in the public domain.

Acknowledgment: the Robin and Fantomas plugins are directly adapted from
reference implementations provided by the LS-design authors.


How to try a built-in primitive
-------------------------------

Type in a terminal:
> make auto TARGET=zorro
to create the 'auto' binary for target cipher zorro.

How to plug in a new primitive
------------------------------

Say the new primitive is called mysterion.

Then a file called mysterion.h should be put in the same folder as auto.c

This file should contain the following information:

  #define STATE_SIZE [size of the state in bits]
  #define CONST_NUM  [number of round constants]

  void mysterion_init();
This function will be called once at startup. This should contain any necessary
setup before the cipher can be used, such as precomputing a table. For most
implementations, there is no such setup, so this function can be empty.

  void mysterion_const(void *data, int i);
This should write the i-th STATE_SIZE-bit round constant at the memory location
'data' points to.

  void mysterion(void *data);
This should perform the mysterion round function on the STATE_SIZE-bit data. The
bit ordering is unimportant as long as it is consistent with mysterion_const().

That is all. The 'auto' binary can be created for mysterion with:
> make auto TARGET=mysterion

Of course if the new primitive relies on particular object files being compiled,
the Makefile should be modified accordingly.

Other parameters
----------------

NTHREAD in auto.c should be set to the number of available cores.

The 'auto' program accepts a single integer parameter. This is used as the random
seed (zero by default). So './auto 1' and './auto 2' run independent tests.

Warning: for state sizes that are not multiple of 64 bits, little endian ordering
is assumed.
